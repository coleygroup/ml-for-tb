// Notes:
//  1) don't include charges
//  2) The search for salts is a substructure search where the substructure
//     must match the entire fragment, so we don't need to be choosy about bond 
//     types
//  3) The matching is done in order, so if you put the more complex stuff at the
//     bottom the "don't remove the last fragment" algorithm has a chance of
//     of returning something sensible
//  4) Format to add salts: 
//	- list of salts, comma delimited:  [Cl,Br,I]
//	- delimeter:  ~ 
//	- string type:  smarts or smiles
//	- example: [Cl,Br,I]\tsmarts   


// start with simple inorganics:
[Cl,Br,I] ~smarts
[Li,Na,K,Ca,Mg]~smarts
[O,N]~smarts

// "complex" inorganics
[N](=O)(O)O~  smarts
[P](=O)(O)(O)O~smarts
